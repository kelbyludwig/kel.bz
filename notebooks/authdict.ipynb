    "# Skip Lists, Commutative Hashing, and Authenticated Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Goodrich and Tamassia's paper [\"Efficient Authenticated Dictionaries with Skip Lists and Commutative Hashing\"](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~goodrich/cgc/pubs/hashskip.pdf) discuss a few interesting concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Goodrich paper uses the skip list data structure and a concept called _commutative hashing_ to build an _authenticated dictionary_. The described use-case of an authenticated dictionary is a certificate revocation statusing system. In this example a certificate authority (CA) is an authoratative source of a set of certificates and their revocation status. Instead of relying on querying the CA for trustworthy revocation checks, entities interested in revocation status can query other (untrusted) services for revocation status and a non-interactive proof of status from the CA.\n",

    "$h$ - A commutative hash function\n",
    "\n",
    "$S$ - A set of elements for which we want to enable authenticated membership queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "$S_t$ - A linked list at level $t$. $S_0$ is the base list that contains all elements of $S$ in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "$v$ - A node within a linked list $S_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$s$ - A \"start\" node when traversing a skip list.\n",

    "$f(v)$ - A \"label\" computed of a value $v$ that computed from $h$ and the element's position in a skip list.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(s)$ - The label of the start node.\n",
    "\n",
    "$elem(v)$ - The element stored at the node $v$. E.g. The number 32.\n",

    "Skip lists are a data structure that were introduced by [William Pugh](https://epaperpress.com/sortsearch/download/skiplist.pdf) as a (simpler) to implement alternative to self-balancing trees with reasonably efficient search, insertion, and deletion properties.\n",

    "For demonstration purposes, let's build an incomplete version of a skip list and some helper functions. You can skim the details here if you are familar with skip lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "For clarity, I'll stick with naming conventions used in Goodrich's paper. First, let's build a \"Node\" element which will store integer values (i.e. \"elements\" in Goodrich's paper) and pointers to other Nodes."

That is, a commutative hash function $h(x, y)$ is defined to return the same results regardless of the order of the inputs, so there is a trivial case that would normally be considered a collision but is not: $h(x, y) = h(y, x)$.

    "## Intuition for hashing algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "To the author's credit, the implementation of the label function $f$ is straightfoward. I did, however, find the underlying intuition for what the algorithm was accomplishing to be a bit opaque. After working out a few examples, I felt I could approximate the algorithm in my head. My notes follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid confusiong with \"tower\"/\"plateau\" terminology (which is used in the context of a single node) I'll call a vertical stack of at least two nodes (one plateau, at least one tower nodes) a \"column\".\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's focus on the base level of the skip list (Cases 1a and 1b in Section 4.1). My shortest explanation for the base level is $f$ is recursively hashing a path to the nearest \"column\" to $v$'s right. \n",
    "\n",
    "For demonstartion, consider this snippet of the bottom row of a skip list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    |         |                 |                           |\n",
    "[ -Inf ] -> [ 1 ] -> [ 2 ] -> [ 3 ] -> [ 4 ] -> [ 5 ] -> [ Inf ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Working out a few computations of $f(v)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The label of $N_1$ (The base node containing element 1) is: $f(N_1) = h(1, h(2, 3))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The label of $N_2$ is: $f(N_2) = h(2, 3)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The label of $N_3$ is: $f(N_3) = h(3, h(4, h(5, Inf)))$\n",
    "\n",
    "* The label of $N_5$ is: $f(N_5) = h(5, Inf)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how the hash chain for $N_3$ is longer as there are more lone plateau nodes between the 3-column and the Inf-column.\n",
    "\n",
    "For nodes not on the base-level (Cases 2a and 2b in Section 4.1), it's a little trickier to explain all at once. Breaking it down into a two observations, first may help:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Non-base nodes simulateanous hash nodes below and to the right of themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A non-base node $v$'s hash will include the label of other columns, if the column's plateau node is at $v$'s height or below. This is dervied from a Case 2a and 2b. As you move down from a starting node $v$, you are checking $w = right(v)$ at each level. If $w$ is a plateau node (i.e. the top of a new column), you recursively compute the label of that new column (which in turn, will include labels of all columns of the same or lesser height from $w$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting both cases together and hand waving a bit: A label for a node $v$ will include all same-sized or smaller columns to the right of $v$ as well as a hash chain of elements at the base connecting each column. Note the top-left \"start\" node $s$ should be based on the entire structure of the skip-list as all nodes are at least $s$'s height and to the right of $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assuming you have a signed node $s$ for some instance of a skiplist, you can likely create collisions by copying $s$ and adding prepended nodes.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Lack of hash customization.\n",

    "## Duplicates in a skip list\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper makes no mention of duplicate values in the skip list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO(kkl): Test problems with duplicates?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## h(-inf, y)\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper doesn't explicitly mention that you need to handle hashing the element value of `-inf`. Specifically, take the bottom left element of a skip list to be $v$. When applying the label function $f$ (Described in section 4.1) to $v$ we will hit cases 1a/1b (dependent on the node right of $v$). In both cases, we compute $h(elem(v), ...)$ where $elem(v)$ is `-inf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I used SHA256 as the hash function (The authors mentioned they used MD5 in their paper which would suffer from the same problem) one would have to design a mapping from `-inf` to hashable byte strings. For implementation simplicity, I chose to just convert `-inf` cases to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a problem, as this introduces collisions! E.g. h(-inf, 0) == h(0, 0). **TODO(kkl): Demonstrate this**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## plateau vs. tower\n",
    "\n",
    "I added `up` pointers which aren't totally necesary. When traversing the skip list any moves `right` will land you on a plateau.\n",
