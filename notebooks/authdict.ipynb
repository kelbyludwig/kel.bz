    "# Skip Lists, Commutative Hashing, and Authenticated Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Goodrich and Tamassia's paper [\"Efficient Authenticated Dictionaries with Skip Lists and Commutative Hashing\"](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~goodrich/cgc/pubs/hashskip.pdf) discuss a few interesting concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Goodrich paper uses the skip list data structure and a concept called _commutative hashing_ to build an _authenticated dictionary_. The described use-case of an authenticated dictionary is a certificate revocation statusing system. In this example a certificate authority (CA) is an authoratative source of a set of certificates and their revocation status. Instead of relying on querying the CA for trustworthy revocation checks, entities interested in revocation status can query other (untrusted) services for revocation status and a non-interactive proof of status from the CA.\n",

    "\n",
    "## h(-inf, y)\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper doesn't explicitly mention that you need to handle hashing the element value of `-inf`. Specifically, take the bottom left element of a skip list to be $v$. When applying the label function $f$ (Described in section 4.1) to $v$ we will hit cases 1a/1b (dependent on the node right of $v$). In both cases, we compute $h(elem(v), ...)$ where $elem(v)$ is `-inf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I used SHA256 as the hash function (The authors mentioned they used MD5 in their paper which would suffer from the same problem) one would have to design a mapping from `-inf` to hashable byte strings. For implementation simplicity, I chose to just convert `-inf` cases to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a problem, as this introduces collisions! E.g. h(-inf, 0) == h(0, 0). **TODO(kkl): Demonstrate this**.\n",

    "## plateau vs. tower\n",
    "\n",
    "I added `up` pointers which aren't totally necesary. When traversing the skip list any moves `right` will land you on a plateau."
