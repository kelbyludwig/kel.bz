    "# Authenticated Dictionaries with Skip Lists and Commutative Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "Goodrich and Tamassia's paper [\"Efficient Authenticated Dictionaries with Skip Lists and Commutative Hashing”](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~goodrich/cgc/pubs/hashskip.pdf) uses a skip list data structure and a concept called commutative hashing to build an authenticated dictionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Authenticated dictionaries are interesting because they describe a standard way to hash a data set and reveal parts of the hashed data set for authenticated membership queries. Authenticated membership queries allow entities to ask potentially untrusted third parties whether some value exists in a data set and get an answer with metadata that enables verification that the answer is authentic.\n",

Goodrich's paper uses skip lists to implement authenticated dictionaries for similar reasons why one would choose a skip list over other tree-like structures.\n",

After working out a few examples, I felt I could approximate the algorithm in my head. My notes follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid confusion with \"tower\"/\"plateau\" terminology (which is used in the context of a single node) I'll call a vertical stack of at least two nodes (one plateau, at least one tower node) a \"column\".\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's focus on the base level of the skip list (Cases 1a and 1b in Section 4.1). My shortest explanation for the base level is $f$ is recursively hashing a path to the next \"column\" to $v$'s right (if one exists). \n",

    "* A node not on the base level $v$'s hash will include the label columns to its right, *if the column's plateau node is at $v$'s height or below*. This is derived from a Case 2a and 2b. As you move down from a starting node $v$, you are checking $w = right(v)$ at each level. If $w$ is a plateau node (i.e. the top of a new column), you recursively compute the label of that new column (which in turn, will include labels of all columns of the same or lesser height from $w$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting all of this together and hand waving a bit: A label for a node $v$ will include all same-sized or smaller columns to the right of $v$ as well as a hash chain of elements at the base connecting each column. Note the top-left \"start\" node $s$ should be based on the entire structure of the skip-list as all nodes are at least $s$'s height and to the right of $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is still opaque, I recommend working out a few examples of hash trees built out of skip lists. For example the skip list segment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  |                 |\n",

    "Once we can label nodes in the skip list we can start providing authenticated queries. Authenticated queries can prove a given element does or does not exists in a skip list, even if the answer was provided by a potentially untrusted party.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide authenticated queries using the skip list structure, we need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A signature (e.g. ed25519) of the start node's label. This signature comes from some trusted party and allows the trusted party to delegate queries to potentially untrusted middlesystems.\n",

One *inefficient* way of encoding authentication information is hashing every element of the skip list in one big hash: `h(-inf | 1 | 2 | ...)`. This is inefficient as the authentication information would have to contain every value within the skip list. In other words, every membership query would return the entire set of values in the skip list in response.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more efficient way of providing authentication information involves building a hash tree and revealing only parts of the set that need to be revealed and otherwise revealing hashes of sub-components of the skip list. For example, if I want to provide a proof that the value `3` exists in my skip list, I will need to reveal `3` but I might not need to reveal that `7` and `11` are also in the skip list. Instead, we build authentication information that will reveal values close to `3` but when we can, we will otherwise reveal hashes like `h(7, 11)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to handle authenticated queries for when queried values *don't* exist in the skip list. This is accomplished by revealing a few nodes that are around the queried value. E.g. If you query for the value `4` and `4` is not in my skip list, I can prove non-membership by providing authentication information that reveals the values (for example) `1`, `3`, and `5`.\n",

    "### Why is commutative hashing valuable?\n",
    "\n",
    "At first I thought the \"simplify the verification process\" argument for commutative hashing was confusing. That is, if I provided you an ordered set and defined set hashing as `h(s[0], h(s[1], h(s[2],...` commutativity doesn't make things simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have since come around to the value-add of commutative hashing. I believe commutativity makes implementation simpler when we account for the difference between how sets of elements are hashed when hashing a skip list and how elements of a query authentication information set are hashed.\n",
    "\n",
    "My intuition here is that when hashing a skip list, we start from the outside hashing down and to the right. Therefore, we build deeply nested hashes-of-hashes (`h(h(h(h(…`) before we reach values/elements. When we are building authentication information we build $Q(X)$ starting with the nodes near the queried element ($X$). \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, when hashing a skip list, we hash in a depth-first manner. E.g. `h(h(h(3, 4), 2), 1)`. However, when a verifier is hashing authentication information, it hashes along the way: `h(1, h(2, h(3, 4)))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commutative hashing means `h(h(h(3, 4), 2), 1) = h(1, h(2, h(3, 4)))`. Without commutative hashing, I believe either the builder of query authentication information or verifiers would have re-order the set of elements before hashing.\n",

    "Regardless, I think this is avoidable if your set of skip list elements is finite. I avoided this in my implementation by assuming my set of skip lists elements would be 256-bit numbers, and I encoded `-Inf` and `Inf` as 264-bit numbers. This makes it such that the hash of `-Inf` or `Inf` doesn't obviously collide with other valid skip list elements."
