       <b>----[ About Me ]</b>
    
       I am an Austin-based security engineer with a background in computer science.
       My personal and professional technical interests are in software security and 
       cryptography. I pride myself on my near-constant pursuit of furthering my own
       understanding of computer security, as well as my often-pragmatic attitude.

       <b>----[ Work Experience ]</b>

       <b>------ [ Cisco (Duo) - Tech Lead Security Engineering - Mar 2017 => Oct 2019</b>

       At Duo, I was one of the original Engineers on the Security Engineering team.
       As a Security Engineer I supported Product and  Engineering teams by enabling 
       them to easily ship secure software to our customers. This included:

       * Reviewing and contributing to software designs as a security expert.
       * Conducting research to investigate new classes of security issues.
       * Performing audits of our products to identify security issues.
       * Providing implementation guidance on common security problems.
       * Improving static analysis tools to better detect issues before deployment.
       * Providing secure-by-default framework APIs for Engineering teams.
       * Leading security defect incidents from triage to resolution.
    
       <b>------ [ Praetorian - Principal Security Engineer - Jan 2014 => Mar 2017</b>
    
       At Praetorian, my primary responsibility was leading, managing, and executing 
       application security assessments.  A majority of my engagement work  involved 
       finding flaws in modern web applications, however, I have also  done software
       security work for many different tech stacks  and  platforms.  In addition to 
       assessment work,  I was also responsible for assisting sales in closing deals
       and was a core contributor to Praetorian's recruiting team.
    
       <b>----[ Projects, Writing, Speaking, and Research ]</b>

       <b>------ [ Attacks on SSO Systems </b>

       "Attacks on SSO Systems" was research that stemmed from a vulnerability class
       affecting SAML implementations that I discovered.  My initial discovery phase
       of this research lead to six CVEs affecting many SAML libraries.  I presented
       on this topic at BlackHat USA 2018 and AppSec USA 2018.

       <b>------ [ Trudy & MITM-VM </b>
    
       Trudy is a modular, and transparent TCP proxy written in Golang. It was built 
       to increase the efficiency of monitoring  &  modifying TCP-based protocols on 
       proxy  unaware devices.  MITM-VM is a  Vagrant virtual  machine that provides 
       proxy and  man-in-the-middle tooling, was well as configures a virtual router 
       that works well with Trudy.

       <b>------ [ noyz </b>
    
       noyz is a Golang implementation of Trevor Perrin's  Noise protocol framework.
       noyz  also has  a  small application layer  with an API modeled  after Golang 
       standard library networking interfaces.

       <b>------ [ Otter </b>
    
       Otter is an extension for Burp Suite  that facilitates authorization testing. 
       Its primary design goal is to make authorization testing for web applications
       as simple as browsing the application with a web browser.

       <b>------ [ CVE-2017-11424 </b>

       CVE-2017-11424 is an issue I identified within the PyJWT Python library which 
       could enable symmetric/asymmetric "key confusion" attacks against its users.

       The patch: https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/pull/277
