My name is Kelby Ludwig. I mostly write about
[cryptography](https://kel.bz/tags/cryptography/) and [software
security](https://kel.bz/tags/software-security/).

I used to do software security consulting and was one of the founding members
of [Duo Security's](https://duo.com/) Application Security team. I currently
work on [Stripe's](https://stripe.com/) security team as a Software Engineer.

If you have questions about my writing or my past research, please feel free to
DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kelbyludwig). If you are in the Austin,
Texas area and want to chat I will happily meet up with you and buy you a
coffee.
